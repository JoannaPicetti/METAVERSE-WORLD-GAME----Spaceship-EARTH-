# ORBIT METAVERSE --> INTERPLANETARY-PEACE-GAME --> EARTH SPACESHIP(s)
METAVERSE where individuals or teams of people come and cooperate to make the world work for 100% of Humanity through a Global Government --> to fix the hardest problems of the Planet -->  SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE - SOLVE INEQUALITY




**Name**: ORBIT METAVERSE --> EARTH SPACESHIP 🌍
**Description**: Simulation tool → to solve the hardest problems of the planet Earth and govern our planet together. 
                                 → to educate people to be responsible planetary citizens.
                                 (Making the planet  better for 100% of Humanity )


**Idea**:  We believe in SPACESHIP EARTH worldview →  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth 


We travel together, passengers on a little spaceship where we encounter to solve hardest problems of the Planet Earth.



EARTH GAME

WORLD PEACE GAME → METAVERSE → SPACESHIP(s)


(Educational Simulation tool to solve hard global problems such as Climate Change or Inequality)

We believe in SPACESHIP EARTH worldview →  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth

EARTH GAME  → we travel together, as passengers on a little space ship 


The Earth Game” is not a “political problem” to be worked out and decided by political leaders, but rather a “design revolution” to be developed by all the people, environmental architects, scientists, engineers and artists through a form of “spontaneous collaboration”.

We have the technology tools →  Blockchain - Crypto - Web3

We have Tech & Science to create a unique global opportunity where every kid and human being could have access to billionaire levels of wealth.


Why a game? Why a world game? 
We choose to call this project “Game” because we want it seen as something that is accessible to everyone, not just the elite few in the power structure who thought they were running the show.

We are in 2022 - We have VR/AR/AI - METAVERSE 

By a World Game →  Gaming Simulation / Metaverse we create the space to allow 8 billion people to Govern our Planet together and to exercise our power, to solve big problems of the Planet together, and to learn to be responsible Planetary Citizens. 

We are sick & tired of an Earth with the illogic of 200 Nation State admirals all trying to steer the spaceship in different directions. 

With EARTH GAME we force the political process to move in the direction that we the people value

We choose to use the technological tools→ Social Media - Web3 for the people. 

It’s not what technology does that matters, but who it does it for and who it does it to

Metaverse EARTH GAME  is the next evolution of our social connection.

We find a problem with NFTs, Web3, Defi projects… so many guys are building this to be rich.

We are using the technology tools for projects for people → about people 

We are not here just to make ourselves rich, famous or top consumers, we are here for all of Humanity. 

We now need a systems approach that deals with the world as a whole.

The entire world is now the relevant unit of analysis, not the Cities, Not Nation States. We are onboard a Spaceship altogether.



PURPOSE OF THE GAME →

EARTH GAME → SPACESHIP  where individuals or teams of people came and competed, or cooperated, to “Make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.”

→ to solve the hardest problems of the planet and govern our planet together. 
→ to educate people to be responsible planetary citizens.
(Making the planet  better for 100% of Humanity )

We are not here just to make ourselves rich, famous or top consumers, we are here for all of Humanity. 

“Make the world work for 100% of humanity through a cooperation that arises from a fundamental transparency of society and its needs”

We do not need to be controlled by Nations States by Central Banks or by Institutions that are stuck in the past, we do not want to be controlled, enforced and coerced by a strong military” .

If everyone knows what the situation is, has a clear vision of what should be and what needs to be done, we cooperate to get it done—as we do as a society in times of emergency.

We have to organize to make PEACE in the world. 

WORLD PEACE GAME, participants would come to play from around the planet, irrespective of their political ideology or local concerns. One model of how it could work had players focused on a problem, like world food availability or hunger, for a certain time period, say a week. 

The team or individual that demonstrated how, using current technology and known resources, hunger could be eliminated in ten years, would “win”. 

The team that could show how it could be done in a shorter time, or by using less resources, or costing less, or accomplishing more than one thing at a time, such as providing clean water as well as eliminating malnutrition, would win round 2. 

Round 3 would be won by an effort that was even “better”. The next week the focus would shift to energy, or health or infrastructure, build cities or education... or climate change.

They will earn Token Recognition and Token money to be paid for their job to the Planet.

The strategies for solving a given problem would become ever more compelling as they demonstrated how all humanity “won”— that the game of the world was not the zero-sum I win/you lose variety, but the total wealth increasing kind. 

Goal → people from around the world assume leadership for the world for twenty years and address the problems of their region and the whole world. 

Some of the problems are local in origin, others are global in scope. Both these active, information-intensive games involve people in solving the critical problems facing global humanity. 

Participants learn a huge amount about the world, its resources, problems, options for development and what they can do to actively engage in solving the problems that their values deem important. 

“People will PLAY TO EARN “

They do this, as the word “game” implies, while having some fun in the process.

Both these tools help people recognize, define and solve global problems and local problems in a global context. 

They tap the creative imaginations of groups as diverse as high school students to corporate executives. 

There is even now a Junior World Game for younger players. In addition to these engaged learning and problem solving processes the Institute also has developed some research tools. 


EARTH GAME → Metaverse is social 
 
3D spaces in the metaverse will let you: 
 
Learn, collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine.
The Metaverse to life together.

THE FUTURE OF WORK →  is Not Corporate — It’s DAOs and Crypto Networks → A16z article

In the EARTH GAME people will earn income in non-traditional ways by taking actions such as:

→ Play to earn
→ Solving problems of the world to earn
→ Learning to earn
→ Build to earn

The traditional way to make money was “work-to-earn,” but the future of income is “x-to-earn” — play to earn, learn to earn, create to learn, and work to earn. 
It will require new decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that can coordinate all this new activity outside the context of corporate systems. And the earning opportunities available in DAOs will be a function of the different types of contributions DAOs need







EARTH GAME → METAVERSE → GLOBAL GOVERNMENT


Imagine the Institutions we have now in the world but in VR in the Metaverse, and where 8 billion people can participate.

United Nations, WEF, NATO… Cop 27

1st Build the space:  “PLANET EARTH METAVERSE”

Users: 
People
Companies
Nations States

Some core use cases in the METAVERSE of Planet Earth: *

UBI 
Recognition Token
Transparent gov spending
Automated taxation
Land registry


Comments:


Recognition token → few people , the ones who really are moving things forward, like Elon
Crypto token → to be paid for your tasks →the more value you add to the Planet the more you get

Taxation:  https://gitcoin.co/grants/4349/blockchain-taxation-protocol-global-tax-quadratic  
(People in Crypto are used to paying gas fee, we can move gas fee as a taxation, and start collecting to redistribute then)
               CARBON TAX for companies who is not taking care of the Planet

Land Registry: we are learning here in the Hackaton we can use NFT for gamming. (NFT certificate for land property…)
Transparent gov spending → everyone can track every transaction 

(We are putting physical assets into small files) → Stored in IPFS - FILECOIN 


Purpose → educate people to exercise their power by voting and taking part to solve the global problems of the planet. 



Some problems solved:


Everyone can track the Global Money in the Planet Earth --> Cryptoeconomics

We are building TRUST , we can also track the business between the Private Sector and Governments.

“Private Public Partnership can finally be achieved.”

We are UNITE the planet:  PRIVATE SECTOR + PUBLIC SECTOR + CIVIL SOCIETY

Of course inequality is something hard to solve but we can move money from richest to poor countries.

We are solving Institutional Crisis, all the institutions were created after WWI - WWII

Uncomfortable for so many but we have to discuss: “Power Laws”



*We can discuss about it at the Planetary Council:   https://planetarycouncil.org/




Requirements: 

Do you have any idea where they will be pulled up from so that we can assign it to the metaverse?

Was thinking in FORBES → Something like forbes to measure companies
Was thinking in OECD → Something like oecd  to measure Nations States

Future → Tokenize People → Celebrities, Athletes, politicians, influencers….

They have to be paid public → by Tokens in EARTH GAME Metaverse

We can track the salaries of people like Messi, Pope, Celebrities, Influencers….

When one Billionaire wants to donate → Instead to build an NGOs and decide alone → Show the money you want to donate in the Metavers and 8 billion people can vote where this money goes → Like taxation.

All public, all transparent → This is the way to rebuild TRUST in the Planet.


1. Users: What are the factors for the people / Companies / Nation States ( Is there a specific identity you will be giving to them) 

People → Planetary Citizenship → Planet Earth Passports (they can receive UBI and Recognition Token)
Companies → Certificate ….? Something like Forbes → Best companies, most impactful, free carbon..?
Nations → Certificate..? → Maybe also recognition? powerful cities… best Nations… measure like..OECD

2. Recognition Token: What is the current status. Is it been developed or do we need to start from the scratch 

Funding Commons → Last session was a super impressive presentation about that, watch again.
https://www.impactcerts.com/

3. UseCases: What is the plan to implement them and how do we generate income or grant out of this?


Income → Platform payed from itself 1% of all the taxes go to the platform
              → People have to pay to get the Planet Passport 
              → Companies, maybe a fee for being part of ????  — Also through Branding …?
              → Nations States → They will compete here to attract citizens —> How…?

Maybe we can do a merge with Gitcoin for the Grants, people can build there → The more value you add to the planet the more UBI you receive —> The more Token recognition you receive → Then you are climbing in 2 big list —> (Like Forbes) → The most millionaires / The most impactful people

*Notice Forbes has lists for most Powerful People → they divide by region, by gender… age.

Forbes also has philanthropic score →  Philanthropic score?...  

Why the billionaires create NGOs (To avoid taxes or for helping in reality)

Why do they alone decide where to allocate the money they are donating ?

Why can they not put the money in the Planet Earth DAO where all the people can vote ?



WE ARE RE-BUILDING TRUST


WE NEED EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS → NEW ERA → CRYPTO INSTITUTIONS

We need new ones with purposes of this ERA - after WWIII --> DIGITAL ECONOMY - CRYPTO ECONOMICS


WE ARE SOLVING CRISIS OF INSTITUTIONS


WE ARE SETTLE THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE SPACE GOVERNANCE
